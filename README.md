Actually, not only for this project, if we need to know the sequence for data Preprocessing:

- Step 1: Data Collection and intial inspection
- Step 2: Handling Missing values: Fill or impute missing values using SimpleImputer or another appropriate method (e.g., mean, median, mode, or a custom strategy).
- Step 3: Handling Outlier: Detect outliers using statistical methods (e.g., boxplots, z-scores) or domain knowledge.And, We can remove them or use robust scaling techniques (e.g., RobustScaler) that reduce their impact.
- Step 4: Encoding Categorical Variables: Identify categorical columns. Encode binary categorical variables using LabelEncoder. And, Encode multi-category variables using OneHotEncoder or pd.get_dummies().
- Step 5: Splitting the data in X and y
- Step 6: Feature Scaling: Apply scaling methods to numerical features to bring them to a similar scale. Common scalers include StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.
- Step 7: Pipeline creation: Create a pipeline using Pipeline or make_pipeline to ensure that the preprocessing steps and the model training are applied sequentially and consistently.Also, Combine preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling, encoding) using ColumnTransformer if necessary.
- Step 8: Model Training
- Step 9: Model Evaluation
- Step 10: Model Deployment.

What is Linear Regression?
- Imagine we have a bunch of points scattered on a piece of paper, and we want to draw a straight line that goes through as many points as possible or at least gets as close to as many points as possible. This straight line is called the "line of best fit."

The Line of Best Fit:
- This line is special because it shows the general trend of our points. If we are looking at points representing how much(time) we've studied for a test (x-axis) and the scores we got (y-axis), the line of best fit would show the overall relationship between studying time and scores.

The Equation of a Line: y = mx + b
- y: This is the value we are trying to predict (like our test score).
- x: This is the value we are using to make predictions (like how many hours we studied).
- m: This is the slope of the line. It tells us how much y changes for a change in x. If m is 2, it means for every extra hour we study, our score goes up by 2 points.
- b: This is the y-intercept. It tells us where the line crosses the y-axis. It's the value of y when x is 0. If b is 10, it means if we didn't study at all (x=0), we might still get a score of 10.
