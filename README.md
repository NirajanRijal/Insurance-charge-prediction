Actually, not only for this project, if we need to know the sequence for data Preprocessing:

Step 1: Data Collection and intial inspection
Step 2: Handling Missing values: Fill or impute missing values using SimpleImputer or another appropriate method (e.g., mean, median, mode, or a custom strategy).
Step 3: Handling Outlier: Detect outliers using statistical methods (e.g., boxplots, z-scores) or domain knowledge.And, We can remove them or use robust scaling techniques (e.g., RobustScaler) that reduce their impact.
Step 4: Encoding Categorical Variables: Identify categorical columns. Encode binary categorical variables using LabelEncoder. And, Encode multi-category variables using OneHotEncoder or pd.get_dummies().
Step 5: Feature Engineering
Step 6: Splitting the data in X and y
Step 7: Feature Scaling: Apply scaling methods to numerical features to bring them to a similar scale. Common scalers include StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.
Step 8: Pipeline creation: Create a pipeline using Pipeline or make_pipeline to ensure that the preprocessing steps and the model training are applied sequentially and consistently.Also, Combine preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling, encoding) using ColumnTransformer if necessary.
Step 9: Model Training
Step 10: Model Evaluation
Step 11: Model Deployment.
